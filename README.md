# Neural Network in C++

## Tests
Head over to the `test` folder in order to see some examples. If you want to run the MNIST test, then you should download the MNIST dataset from kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/darkgeekms/text-file-for-mnist-dataset/data
and then put the file `Train.txt` into the main directory: `NeuralNetwork/`
 
- To run all of these tests, `cd` into the `test` directory and simply type `make` in terminal.
- To run only the MNIST test, simply type: `make MNIST`
- To run only the apply_grad test, simply type: `make Grad`
- To run only the Simple test, simply type: `make Simple`
- To run only the AutoEncoder test, simply type: `make AutoEncoder`

## How did I make this project?

The 3blue1brown neural network youtube series really helped me here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi
