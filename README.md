# Neural Network in C++

## Running the program
- `cd` into this directory and `make`

## How did I make this project?

The 3blue1brown neural network youtube series really helped me here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi

## How did I test it?

I tested my library by using an encoder / decoder neural network. This is probably the best way to test out a neural network because it tests if the forward/back propagation can work with the input size higher than the output size, or vise versa. Head over to `test.cpp` to see how I implemented this. I also did an another test (just in case) with 3 layers, and it worked fine as well.
