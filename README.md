# NeuralNetwork
Neural Network in c++

To run, you need the dataset.
Download Train.txt from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/darkgeekms/text-file-for-mnist-dataset/data
Drag the Train.txt file to the folder of this directory.
In terminal, cd into the folder of this directory.
Then type in c++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o main && ./main && rm main

WARNING: The Neural Network is slow. All I wanted to do is setup the basics of Neural Network.
